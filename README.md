Hi, I'm Jacob dGM! I'm a web developer, learner and musician.

### I'm a programmer

### I'm a learner

### I'm a musician

As a musician, I mostly play Irish traditional music on violin, guitar, mandolin and penny whistle. In the past, I've also spent time playing jazz, mostly on bass, guitar, violin, and a little bit on piano. I have a master's degree in Music Theory.

My interest in music and music theory has inspired many of my personal projects.
- When I was just beginning to learn Python, I made **[fretboard-generator](https://github.com/jacobdgm/fretboard-generator/tree/main)**, a small collection of functions for generating fretboard diagrams for fretted string instruments. Looking back, I can see it was programmed someone just starting to get serious about programming, but I think it still holds up alright. Perhaps I'll return to it some day.
- A little later, I made **[pitch-classes](https://github.com/jacobdgm/pitch-classes)**, a collection of functions for exploring musical scales in alternate tuning systems. I'm not sure who would use it, but it was a good way for me to explore object-oriented programming and unit testing.
- While at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) in summer 2021, I collaborated with [@jackckelly](https://github.com/jackckelly) on **[irish-tunes](https://github.com/jacobdgm/irish-tunes)**, an effort to train a language model to generate traditional Irish dance tunes. While we didn't end up creating a tool to generate an infinite quantity of new and interesting trad tunes, I was pleased and surprised by the progress we made (in that by the end, our neural network was outputting tunes with mostly the right number of beats per measure). I spent much of my time exploring our training dataset and figuring out how to clean it and convert it into the most useful form possible.
- Also at Recurse Center, I collaborated with [@maneshd](https://github.com/maneshd) to make **[kebyar](https://github.com/jacobdgm/kebyar/)**, a tool for exploring the interlocking patterns found in Balinese gamelan music using [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org).
