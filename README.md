Hi, I'm Jacob deGroot-Maggetti! I think of myself as a programmer, a learner and a musician.

My personal website is https://jacobdgm.com, and you can reach me at jacob@jacobdgm.com.

### I'm a learner

A couple of my central interests are pedagogy and effective learning techniques. When learning facts, I take advantage of spaced repetition, interleaving, and above all, active recall. When learning and teaching new skills, I learn primarily by doing, complementing this with relevant factual learning. Since I began to learn to program during the pandemic, I've learned a bunch of new skills while working on a series of projects:
- While setting up **[my personal website](https://jacobdgm.com)** ([code](https://github.com/jacob-dgm/jacob-dgm.github.io/)) I learned about
  - CSS,
  - the conventions of HTML and semantic HTML,
  - the basics of Git and GitHub, and
  - some things about setting up projects so they can grow and evolve over time. (If I were to set it up now, I might be tempted to use a framework like Django. But I like that it uses static HTML, and that it still bears the marks of the design choices I made at the beginning and those I made along the way. It has its quirks, but I love it as it is!)
- **[fretboard-generator](https://github.com/jacobdgm/fretboard-generator/)** was a productive initial exercise in creating a project in Python, as I set up a group of functions that worked well with each other. It also yielded lessons on how to structure projects.
- From **[pitch-classes](https://github.com/jacobdgm/pitch-classes)**, I learned about classes in Python and object-oriented programming, and about unit testing and test-driven development.
- Working with [@jackckelly](https://github.com/jackckelly) on **[irish-tunes](https://github.com/jacobdgm/irish-tunes)**, I learned about Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, and cleaning and standardizing data from a range of sources.
- Working with [@maneshd](https://github.com/maneshd) on **[kebyar](https://github.com/jacobdgm/kebyar/)**, I learned about programming in JavaScript, got a taste of the quirks and peculiarities of various web browsers, and had my first experience diving deep into documentation as we worked with [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org).
- I worked on these last two projects during my time at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) in summer 2021, an organization that does a great job modelling learning by doing!
- I've spent the past year and a bit working at [DDMAL](https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca), developing **[CANTUS Database](https://cantusdatabase.org)** ([code](https://github.com/DDMAL/CantusDB)). I learned a great deal working on this project:
  - about Django
  - about navigating a big, existing codebase
  - about collaborating on an active project using Git and GitHub
  - about Docker and Nginx

### I'm a musician

As a musician, I mostly play Irish traditional music on violin, guitar, mandolin and penny whistle. In the past, I've also spent time playing jazz, mostly on bass, guitar, violin, and a little bit on piano. I have a master's degree in Music Theory.

My interest in music and music theory has inspired many of my personal projects.
- Though **[fretboard-generator](https://github.com/jacobdgm/fretboard-generator/tree/main)** was an early project, this collection of functions for generating fretboard diagrams for fretted string instruments continues to do its job well, and I still use it from time to time.
- **[pitch-classes](https://github.com/jacobdgm/pitch-classes)** is a collection of functions for exploring musical scales in alternate tuning systems.
-  **[irish-tunes](https://github.com/jacobdgm/irish-tunes)** was an effort (in collaboration with [@jackckelly](https://github.com/jackckelly)) to train a language model to generate traditional Irish dance tunes. While we didn't end up creating a tool to generate an infinite quantity of new and interesting trad tunes, I was pleased and surprised by the progress we made (in that by the end, our neural network was outputting tunes with mostly the right number of beats per measure)!
- **[kebyar](https://github.com/jacobdgm/kebyar/)** (built in collaboration with [@maneshd](https://github.com/maneshd)) is a tool for exploring the interlocking patterns found in Balinese gamelan music.
